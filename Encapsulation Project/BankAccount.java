/*ENCAPSULATION:
 * The process of defining a class by Hiding its data from direct access from the outside class
 * members and providing its access only through publicly accessing setter and getter methods with proper 
 * validations is called "ENCAPSULATION"
 */
/*
 * HOW CAN WE DEVELOP ENCAPSULATION IN JAVA:
 * 1.By declaring all variables as private
 * 2.By defining  one pair of public setter and getter methods.
